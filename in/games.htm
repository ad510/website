<div>Here are some games that don't justify having their own pages, but are still worth mentioning:</div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ad510.github.io/time-dilation-game">Death by Time Travel</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ad510/time-dilation-game">repo</a>): A game with time-warping fields that can take you to the end of the universe, thus "killing" you solely by using time manipulation. Originally made at <a href="https://codeday.org/la">CodeDay LA</a> in February 2016, but I've improved the game since then.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ad510/return-of-the-trojans/releases">Return of the Trojans</a>: This is a team-based shooting game inspired by Star Wars: Battlefront II made by Zachary Metcalf, Vansh Jain, and me using C# and XNA as a final project in fall 2013.</li>
<li><a href="http://ad510.users.sf.net/borderlesstd">Borderless TD</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ad510/borderless-td">repo</a>): In this tower defense-like game, there are bears roaming around an infinitely large forest. You can build wood cutters to collect wood and build towers to tame the bears, and the goal is to survive as long as you can. I wrote the game using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL so you can play it online, though submitting and viewing high scores in the online copy results in error messages since SourceForge developer web doesn't support MySQL. I made this for a computer science class in fall 2012.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ad510/german-whist">German Whist</a>: This is a Java implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Whist">German Whist</a> card game, using a (buggy) client-server model and including an AI client. Checkout the no_networking branch for a version that does not use networking. I made this for a computer science class in fall 2012.</li>
<li><a href="boredgamejam">Bored Game Jam</a>: I had a few hours to make a game for a board game jam hosted by my school's <a href="http://www.megausc.com">game development club</a> in fall 2012, but I didn't want to make a board game so I found an excuse to make this computer game instead. . . .</li>
<li><a href="bigfoot">The Bigfoot Games</a> (made by my brother): In the summer of 2012, I taught my brother Matthew how to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the end result is that he made these 3 Bigfoot-themed games which are now hosted on my website. Here is his <a href="https://mattdowning.wordpress.com/2012/07/03/my-first-three-html-games">blog post</a> describing the games.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ad510/spacejunk">Space Junk</a>: A growing problem is the increasing amount of space junk orbiting around Earth, consisting of unused satellites and bits of objects that aren't used anymore. The game Space Junk encourages you to explore the solar system while keeping the planetary neighborhood clean. You lose health if you run into any object (including your own propellant!) other than those that you collect. There are 4 solar systems in the game: Classic Mode, They Don't Like You, Spawners, and War of the Worlds. I wrote this Qt game in C++ for a computer science class in spring 2012.</li>
</ul>
