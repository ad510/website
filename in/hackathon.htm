<div>I finally discovered the magic of hackathons in the spring 2014 semester!</div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ad510/reprogram-lisp">Reprogramming Lisp</a>: The most powerful language in the world is one that you can turn into any language you want! So I implemented a subset of JavaScript as a read macro at <a href="https://2015s.pennapps.com">PennApps</a> Winter 2015.</li>
<li><a href="https://amelia-burbankgamehack.appspot.com">Amelia</a> (<a href="https://github.com/zachlatta/amelia">repo</a>): Amelia sends a text message to your parents with your current address every time you change location. I finally got to make this with <a href="http://zachlatta.com">Zach Latta</a> at <a href="http://burbankgamehack.com">Burbank Game+Hack</a> in spring 2014, who I wanted to work with at the previous hackathons but couldn't for various reasons. I still have trouble comprehending that we started late and got it working end-to-end with <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine">Google App Engine</a>, <a href="https://moves-app.com">Moves</a> (using <a href="https://dev.moves-app.com/docs/authentication">OAuth</a>, which was a huge pain), <a href="http://tomtom.com">TomTom</a> (for reverse geolocation), and <a href="https://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a> in less than 24 hours, with me using <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a> for the first time! This won 2nd place in the open challenge and the <a href="https://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a> prize.</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.facebook.com/1424657531124217">Wheel of Delivery</a> (<a href="https://github.com/MattNewbill/wheel_of_delivery">repo</a>): This is a web app to help you select a place to deliver stuff to your door, made at <a href="http://lahacks.com">LA Hacks</a> in spring 2014. We aimed for the <a href="https://www.delivery.com">delivery.com</a> prize, and won it simply because (in my opinion) that API was so obscure that no one else was using it much.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jLoven/NurseAlert">Nurse Alert</a>: I helped a new programmer make this Android app to let patients connect with nurses at <a href="http://2014s.pennapps.com">PennApps</a> in spring 2014. Overnight I also wrote <a href="https://github.com/ad510/find_pennapps_hackers">this thing</a> to help me find out about people at PennApps from the comfort of my computer.</li>
<li><a href="pd.htm">Plausible Deniability</a> (formerly Decoherence): This is an RTS game prototype that lets you cheat with plausible deniability. It does this by taking advantage of the fact that you don't really have to make up your mind about what your units do until another player sees them. I kicked off this project during the <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2013/decoherence">2013 Global Game Jam</a>, but <!--I'm still working on it and hoping to-->I've continued working on it and would love to turn it into a full game.</li>
</ul>
