<p><span class="h2">What's new:</span><br/>
I made a <a href="https://ad510.github.io/time-dilation-game">game about time dilation</a> at <a href="https://codeday.org/la">CodeDay LA</a>. It's inspired by the idea that it's possible to kill someone in a game <a href="https://github.com/ad510/time-dilation-game#death-by-time-manipulation">solely by using time manipulation</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://workshops.hackclub.com/find_bigfoot">workshop</a> for <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a>, a nonprofit run by my friend <a href="https://zachlatta.com">Zach Latta</a> to help high school students start and run coding clubs.</p>
<p>I replaced this site's AJAX content loading frontend that I wrote in 2008 with a much simpler <a href="https://github.com/cgrand/enlive">Enlive</a>-based <a href="https://github.com/ad510/website">template system</a>. <b><i>If clicking links redirects you to the home page, try clearing the browser cache.</i></b></p>
