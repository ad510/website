I replaced this site's AJAX content loading frontend that I wrote in 2008 with a much simpler <a href="https://github.com/cgrand/enlive">Enlive</a>-based <a href="https://github.com/ad510/website">template system</a>. <b><i>If clicking links redirects you to the home page, try clearing the browser cache.</i></b></p>
<p>I interned at <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a> this summer and I'm making a <a href="https://github.com/ad510/pdl">Lisp to C compiler</a> in my free time. (By the way, in case you don't find it obvious, the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Amazon.com.)</p>
<!--<p>As far as <a href="interaction.htm">Interaction Lab</a> work is concerned, I did a major upgrade of the multitrack_model ROS package this past summer and fall, and I'm starting to formally evaluate how accurate it is so we can write a paper about it.</p>
<p>After developing it for more than 4 years, we have finally released the game Myrrored in <a href="http://kongregate.com/games/downinggames/myrrored?referrer=downinggames">Flash</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id659979694">iOS</a> editions. We started working on this game before we released <a href="http://maxgames.com/play/momentum-master.html">Momentum Master</a> in 2009!</p>
<p>Over winter break, I worked on 2 ROS packages for the <a href="interaction.htm">Interaction Lab</a>: a GUI for calibrating camera poses and a package which applies a statistical model to help determine which skeletons tracked are of the same user.</p>
<p>I am currently working on projects using ROS in USC's <a href="interaction.htm">Interaction Lab</a>. I will be able to add more details when I am further along with my current project.</p>
My new Flash game <a href="http://maxgames.com/play/momentum-master-2.html">Momentum Master II and the World Wide Web</a> is now sponsored by Max Games and available to play online. Please give it a high rating if you like it!</p>-->
