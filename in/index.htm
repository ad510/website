<p><span class="h2">What's new:</span><br/>
I released a massive code dump of the <a href="https://github.com/ad510/vb6-code-dump">old VB6 programs</a> I made in elementary and middle school. There are a ton of stupid games in there. Executables are included so you don't need VB6 to run them, and many run in <a href="https://winehq.org">Wine</a>.</p>
<p>I made a <a href="https://ad510.github.io/time-dilation-game">game about time dilation</a> at <a href="https://codeday.org/la">CodeDay LA</a>. It's inspired by the idea that it's possible to kill someone in a game <a href="https://github.com/ad510/time-dilation-game#death-by-time-manipulation">solely by using time manipulation</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://workshops.hackclub.com/find_bigfoot">workshop</a> for <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a>, a nonprofit run by my friend <a href="https://zachlatta.com">Zach Latta</a> to help high school students start and run coding clubs.</p>
