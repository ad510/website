<div><a href="https://github.com/ad510/plausible-deniability">Plausible Deniability</a> is an experimental RTS prototype that lets you cheat with plausible deniability. By that, I mean that if you play a multiplayer game and cheat, then even after the opponent watches the replay and compares it to what they saw while they played, it is impossible for them to prove that you cheated (short of hacking into the game or replay file). An example of cheating with plausible deniability is a map hack (seeing the entire map). An example of cheating <i>without</i> plausible deniability is giving yourself extra resources, since opponents can notice that when they watch the replay. But surely map hacks cannot be the only way to cheat with plausible deniability?</div>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can move your units along multiple paths when other players aren't looking, but the moment another player sees your unit moving along a path, the path they see is the one that is taken. This is useful for exploring the map quickly.</li>
<li>You can "share paths" between different units so that you do not have to decide which unit is on which path until another player sees them. This is useful, for example, if you want to keep a sniper out of sight.</li>
<li>If other players don't mind you seeing them cheat, you can hit F3 to do a map hack and check the "automatic time travel" box, which makes your units automatically move in the past to get to where you want them faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key aspect to these features is that anything you don't do is wiped from history, so in replays (press shift + R to view an instant replay), your opponents won't see you doing anything beyond what is allowed in a normal RTS game. This works because you don't <i>really</i> have to make up your mind about what your units do until another player sees them.</p>

All units connected by blue lines are actually different paths of the same sniper. The blue player doesn't have to decide which one is the "real" sniper until the red player sees one of the paths.</p>

From a purely technical perspective, this is a fleshed out proof of concept that incorporates most ways of cheating with plausible deniability that I've thought of apart from exploiting identical units, which would practically require a rewrite to implement. But after I reached this point in summer 2014, I pretty much hit a brick wall because I have no clue how to turn this into an actual game, and neither does anyone I showed it to. That said, if I figure out a way to get unstuck (and simultaneously manage the necessarily complex codebase), I'd still love to turn this into a full multiplayer game.
