    <p>An RTS game that lets you cheat with plausible deniability. Current work in progress <a href="https://github.com/ad510/plausible-deniability">here</a>.</p>
    <p>I worked on this from early 2013 to summer 2014. Then I ran out of ideas and stopped working on it for the moment, though I still really like the concept and hope to revisit it in the future.</p>
    <!--<p>I worked on this from early 2013 to summer 2014. Then I ran out of ideas and I'm no longer actively developing it, though I still really like the concept and may revisit it in the future. If you want the domain name for your own project, email me using the link at my <a href="/">home page</a>, and if I think it is better than my experimental proof of concept then I'll transfer the domain to you for free. (But are you sure you want to take the domain name of my former pet project away from me?) :)</p>
    <p>Sorry if you wanted to take this domain name. I decided to squat on it after seeing someone take decoherencegame.com, which was my previous preferred domain name. (I now think Plausible Deniability is a better name for the game, anyway.) If I find that the game doesn't work out and I don't need the domain name anymore, I'll be sure to free it up so someone else can take it.</p>-->
