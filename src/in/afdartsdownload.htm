This preview release adds an improved implementation of melee combat which you can try out in the scenario "battle". It also adds hills and walls, but it doesn't contain the tutorial or campaign scenarios in the stable releases. It requires the .NET Framework version 2 <a href="http://microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856EACB-4362-4B0D-8EDD-AAB15C5E04F5">(32-bit)</a> <a href="http://microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=B44A0000-ACF8-4FA1-AFFB-40E78D788B00">(64-bit)</a> and the <a href="http://microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2DA43D38-DB71-4C1B-BC6A-9B6652CD92A3">DirectX End-User Runtime</a>.</p>

<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/downinga-rts/rts1.0.3pre.ppt">Afdarts 1.0.3pre embedded in PowerPoint</a>: Just for the fun of it, I ported an Afdarts 1.0.3 prerelease version to VBA and embedded it in a PowerPoint macro. If you don't mind temporarily lowering your PowerPoint security settings, make sure you have a copy of a 1.0.x version and feel free to try it out.<br/>
<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/downinga-rts/rts1.0.1coltest.zip">Afdarts 1.0.1 experimental collision response version</a>: This uses a couple previously experimental collision responses I hacked together a while ago. One of the collision responses it uses is used in Afdarts 1.1.1 alpha and later, but I'm keeping it on the download page in case you want to see the other one.</p>-->
<p><span class="h2">Directions for Windows Vista/7:</span><br/>
Afdarts 1.1.1 or earlier does not work on Windows Vista or later out of the box. After installing or extracting Afdarts 1.1.1 or earlier, you have to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="http://www.dlldump.com/download-dll-files_new.php/dllfiles/D/dx8vb.dll/5.03.2600.2180/download.html">dx8vb.dll</a> (and <a href="http://windowsxp.mvps.org/comdlg32.htm">comdlg32.ocx</a> if you want to use the model editor), or preferably copy them from Windows XP. (McAfee SiteAdvisor tells me that <a href="https://www.siteadvisor.com/sites/dlldump.com">both</a> <a href="https://www.siteadvisor.com/sites/mvps.org">sites</a> are safe and my virus scanner reports that both files are safe, but you should check for yourself anyway.)</li>
<li>Copy the 2 files to the directory that Afdarts is in. If you used the installer, the default directory on 32-bit computers is "C:\Program Files\Andrew D\Afdarts" and on 64-bit computers is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Andrew D\Afdarts". Accept any User Account Control prompts.</li>
<li>Right click Afdarts.exe (the one with the green circle icon) and press "Run as administrator". I tested this on my computer with Windows Vista and it worked every time, but if it doesn't work on your computer and you have the latest 1.0.x version, please <a href="emai1.htm">tell me</a>. Afdarts should create "unregister dx8vb.bat" in the directory it is in, which will undo the changes if run as administrator. After Afdarts is working, you don't need to run it as an administrator.</li>
</ol>
